'''
Problem : A numeric string, s, is beautiful if it can be split into a sequence of two or more positive integers, a[1], a[2]....a[n], 
satisfying the following conditions:

1. a[i] - a[i-1] = 1, for any 1 < i <= n (i.e., each element in the sequence is 1 more than the previous element).
2. No a[i] contains a leading zero. For example, we can split s = 10203 into the sequence {1, 02, 03}, but it is not beautiful because 02 and 03 have leading zeroes.
3. The contents of the sequence cannot be rearranged. For example, we can split s = 312 into the sequence {3, 1, 2}, but it is not beautiful because it breaks our first constraint (i.e., 1 - 3 â‰  1 ).

You must perform q queries where each query consists of some integer string s. 
For each query, print whether or not the string is beautiful on a new line. 
If it's beautiful, print YES x, where x is the first number of the increasing sequence. 
If there are multiple such values of x, choose the smallest. Otherwise, print NO.
