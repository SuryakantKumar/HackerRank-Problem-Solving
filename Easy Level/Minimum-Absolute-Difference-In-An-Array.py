Problem : Consider an array of integers, arr = [arr[0], arr[1]....arr[n]]. 
We define the absolute difference between two elements, a[i] and a[j] (where i â‰  j), to be the absolute value of a[i] - a[j].

Given an array of integers, find and print the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the array. 
For example, given the array arr = [-2, 2, 4] we can create 3 pairs of numbers: [-2, 2], [-2, 4] and [2, 4]. 
The absolute differences for these pairs are 4, 6 and 2. The minimum absolute difference is 2.

            diff = (arr[i] - arr[j])
            if diff < 0:
                diff *= -1
            if diff < absolute:
