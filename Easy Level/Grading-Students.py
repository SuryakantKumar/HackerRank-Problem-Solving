Problem : HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

째 Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
째 Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.

Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:

째 If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
째 If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

For example, grade = 84 will be rounded to 85 but grade = 29 will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than 40.

Given the initial value of grade for each of Sam's n students, write code to automate the rounding process.
