Problem : Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix arr is shown below:
1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  

The left-to-right diagonal 1 + 5 + 9 = 15. The right to left diagonal 3 + 5 + 9 = 17. Their absolute difference is |15 - 17| = 2.

    for i in range(n):
        sum1 += arr[i][i]
        
    for k in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        sum2 += arr[n-k-1][k]
        
    diff = sum1 - sum2
    if diff < 0 :
        diff = sum2 - sum1
